// Create a program that tracks items added to a shopping cart.
//
// Initialize the program with an array of objects, representing a cart that already contains 3 items, 
// where each object represents an item with a name (string) and a price (number).
//
// There should be a function that accepts:
// - the array of objects representing items in the cart 
// - an object representing an item to add, also containing a name and price.
// 
// The function should:
// - add a new entry to the array of items in the cart
// - log out a message that lets the user know the name of the item added to the cart
// - return the total number of items in the cart.
//
// Separately, use the return value of the function to log out how many items are in the cart.
//
// BONUS: Inside the function, log out "You can no longer use the express checkout!"
// if there are 7 or more items in the cart.
